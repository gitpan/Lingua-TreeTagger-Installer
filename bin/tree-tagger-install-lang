=head1 NAME

tree-tagger-install-lang - install language parameter files for treetagger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # lists available and installed parameter files
  tree-tagger-install-lang -l

  # installs parameter file
  tree-tagger-install-lang -i PT-1

  # force installation of parameter file, with verbose mode on
  tree-tagger-install-lang -v -i -f PT-1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tree Tagger is a tagger, available from
L<http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/>. Its
manual installation is tiresome, error prone, and headache generator.

This module tries to help that:

=over 4

=item 1.

When you install the module, it will install the tree-tagger binary
for your platform.

=item 2.

It will install this tool as well (C<tree-tagger-install-lang>) that
can be used to install parameter files for different languages.

=head1 BUGS and LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item *

When there are multiple parameter files for the same encoding, only
one can be installed at a time. The installation script detects that
and warns the user. The user is able to force the installation with
C<-f>. Future releases might add alternative naming scheme.

=item *

The list of installed parameter files is saved under your home folder,
in a dot file. Usually only the system administrator will be able to
install parameter files, and therefore the dot file will be up to date
with his actions. If multiple users can install parameter files each
one will have a dot file, and the information will not be coherent.

=item *

Although more architectures are available at Tree Tagger home page, at
the moment I just support linux (both 32 and 64 bits) and Mac OS X on
Intel hardware. Future versions might support further architectures
and operating systems. Patches are welcome.

=item *

The basic Tree Tagger tarballs include a lot of scripts that does not
work without the respective parameter files. At the moment those
scripts are installed anyway, but will not work if the respective
parameter file is not available.
