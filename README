  Lingua::TreeTagger::Installer
 -------------------------------

 This small module (erm, installation script) downloads TreeTagger [1],
 TreeTagger perl scripts and TreeTagger language parameters,
 installing them on your system.

 Please note that the COPYRIGHT statement of this installation tool is
 NOT the same as TreeTagger license. Please read TreeTagger liecense
 at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~schmid/Tagger-Licence

 
 Finally, I would like to thank you Micheal Schwern for all his help
 converting ExtUtils::MakeMaker initial script to Module::Build.



 NOTE: the files under extrafiles are copyrighted accordingly with
 TreeTagger license. They should not be distributed in this manner,
 but I will keep them here while the original TreeTagger packages do
 not include them.
